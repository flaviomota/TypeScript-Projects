# TypeScript Projects Repository

Welcome to the **TypeScript and React Projects Repository**! This repository houses various TypeScript and React projects that cover a range of applications and utilities. Each project is organized in its respective directory within the repository.

## Projects

### 1. Maps - Web Application

#### **Description**

This project is a web application built using **TypeScript**. It's going to randomly generate a user and randomly generate a company. Every user in every company is going to have a **location property** tied to it as well. Then I'm going to use that location to show them as markers on a **Google map** inside the browser.

### 2. Sorting

#### **Description**

The goal of this project is to take different data structures and **sort them** simply from least to greatest. For example, an array of numbers should be sorted with the lowest numbers in front, highest numbers in back, a string should be sorted by **lowercase character order**.

### 3. Stats - Node.js

#### **Description**

This TypeScript project involves extracting data from a **CSV-formatted spreadsheet** and loading it into a **Node.js application**. Subsequently, the data will be parsed to transform it into a usable data structure. Following this, the application will conduct **statistical analysis** on the data. The specific analyses are not clearly defined but could include determining the **average number of goals scored per game**, identifying the team with the **most victories or losses**, and potentially other analyses. Finally, the project aims to generate a **report**, which could be presented as terminal output, an HTML file, or in another format. Overall, the project involves data extraction, parsing, statistical analysis, and report generation using a Node.js application.

### 4. Web Framework

#### **Description**

The project involves creating a **client-side web framework** from scratch, similar to popular frameworks like **React or Angular**. The primary purpose of this framework is to handle tasks such as fetching data, rendering content on the screen, and managing user events. The demonstration of the completed application showcases a simple interface with features like updating a person's name, changing their age randomly, and persisting data to a backend server with a save button.

Although the presented application appears straightforward, the emphasis is on the underlying framework's complexity. The goal is to provide a foundation that allows users to build more intricate applications by reusing the code already implemented in the framework. The envisioned framework should support dynamic updates to the UI, handling user input, and interacting with a backend server for data persistence. The project's focus lies in the development of the web framework itself rather than building a comprehensive application with it.

### 5. Server - TypeScript + Express

#### **Description**

The project implements a custom web framework using **TypeScript and Express decorators**. The goal is to create decorators that simplify the process of defining routes, handling request validation, applying middleware, and marking a class as a controller.

The project aims to automate the process of handling routes, request validation, and middleware application by using custom decorators. The challenge lies in creating a cohesive system that seamlessly integrates with TypeScript and Express, providing a clean and efficient way to define controllers and their associated routes.

### 6. Redux-TypeScript

#### **Description**

The project involves creating a web application that allows users to input a package name through a text input field. Upon clicking the submit button, the application will make a request to the **NPM (Node Package Manager) API** to retrieve information about packages related to the specified name (in this case, "React"). The retrieved data will then be displayed on the screen, showing the names of the relevant packages.

Despite the apparent simplicity of the task, the project emphasizes the complexity that arises during the implementation, especially in the context of **Redux and TypeScript**. The use of Redux implies managing state and actions in a predictable and maintainable way, while TypeScript introduces **static typing** to enhance code quality.

### 7. React-Redux-TypeScript

#### **Description**

The goal of this project is to build a simple **React and Redux application using TypeScript**. The application's main functionality is to fetch a list of to-dos from a **fake JSON API**, display them on the screen, and allow users to **delete a to-do by clicking on it**.

The primary goal of the project is to explore how **TypeScript can be effectively integrated with React and Redux**. The simplicity of the application allows for a focused understanding of TypeScript usage within this specific context.

**Happy coding!**
